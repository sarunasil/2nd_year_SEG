The disabled components represent functionality that will be delivered in the next product presentations.

The credentials given launches the product from the view of a superuser that is built-in for showcasing purposes.

Currently only this superuser can be an owner of a campaign allowing him to view the Main Statistics about a specific campaign.

The superuser can also register a new client and it is possible to login.

The functionality to assign a campign to the new client is still being developed.

This newly registered client will not have any campaings assigned to him.

The system should running smoothly on at least 2 gigabytes of RAM.

Thank you for trialing our product.
